    Our paper "Multidimensional RF pulse design using auto-differentiable spin-domain optimization and its application to reduced field-of-view imaging" has been accepted for publication in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. This work presents a novel algorithm for designing multidimensional radiofrequency pulses using spin-domain representation, enabling efficient design of 3D pulses for reduced field-of-view imaging.
