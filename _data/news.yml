    Our paper "Bilevel Optimized Implicit Neural Representation for Scan-Specific 
    Accelerated MRI Reconstruction" has been accepted for publication in Nature 
    Medical Imaging. This work presents a novel framework that reduces MRI scan 
    times by 80% while maintaining diagnostic quality.
    
    First author Yu Huang will present these findings at the ISMRM 2025 conference.
