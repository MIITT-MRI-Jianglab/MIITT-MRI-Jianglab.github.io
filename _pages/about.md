The research in my lab focuses on the development of novel MRI acquisition technologies that can improve disease diagnosis for patient care. Our group employs engineering-driven approaches to address unmet clinical-driven needs. We have projects to develop new MRI acquisition schemes and reconstruction algorithms that take advantage of modern MRI hardware and computational capabilities to accelerate the acquisition, improve imaging quality, and extract rich quantitative information that has high sensitivity and specificity of diseases.
